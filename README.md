1.  XP / Level up Mechanics 

	On enemy death, the player is awarded a fixed amount of 75 XP if the assailant was a player.
	This also means marines around you can "killsteal", so step your game up, marine! 
	
	On level up, the player's health is restored to maximum and is given a permanent boost of 5%.  
	To avoid potential game-breaking issues if the player starts reaching ludacris levels, there is a level cap of 100 (from 0 to 100).

	Currently, level progress and XP gained is displayed in the console. 
	To open the console, enable it by adding the command "+set com_allowConsole 1" without the quotation marks to your Quake 4 Launcher.
